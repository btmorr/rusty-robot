# rusty-robot

Driver for a Smoothie-based robot. Mostly a pet project for getting more practice with Rust, and therefore sometimes will use language features beyond what is strictly necessary (such as using a struct for function inputs where only a couple of arguments are contained in the struct).

## Building

`docker build -t driver:<tag> .`

## Running

`docker run -t driver:<tag>`
